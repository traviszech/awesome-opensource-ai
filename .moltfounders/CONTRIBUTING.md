# Contributing to Awesome Open Source AI

Thank you for considering contributing to this curated list. We maintain **elite-tier quality standards** - this list is for battle-tested tools that have proven their value in production environments.

---

## Quality Bar: Battle-Tested & Production-Proven

This is not a directory of every open-source AI project. We curate tools that have survived real-world usage, earned community trust, and demonstrate sustained excellence.

### Elite Tier Criteria (Must Meet ALL)

Projects must satisfy **ALL of the following criteria** to be considered elite-tier. No exceptions except under maintainer discretion for truly exceptional cases.

| Criterion | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **⭐ GitHub Stars** | 1000+ | Indicates broad community adoption and trust |
| **🔄 Active Development** | Meaningful commits within last 30 days | Continuously evolving, not abandoned |
| **🏭 Production Usage** | Evidence of real-world deployment | Case studies, integrations, production issues/PRs |
| **📚 Quality Standards** | Proper docs, tests, releases | Not a thrown-together experiment |

### No Exceptions Except Maintainer Discretion

Meeting 3/4 is **not acceptable**. Projects must meet all criteria. The only path for projects falling short:

- **Maintainer Override** - Reserved for truly exceptional cases with extraordinary production traction or major organizational backing

---

## Curation Philosophy: "Current Best"

This list represents **"what you should know about now"** — not a historical archive.

### Replace, Don't Accumulate

When a newer version clearly supersedes an existing entry in the same category:

| Scenario | Action | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **New major version** | Update existing entry | PyTorch 2.4 → 2.5: Edit the line, don't add both |
| **Minor bump** | Skip unless significant | v1.2 → v1.3: Not worth a PR |
| **Both versions warranted** | Rare exception | Python 3.11/3.12 both deployed; SD 1.5 vs XL (different use cases) |

**The test:** Would a practitioner looking at this list today care about *both* versions, or just the current one?

For rapidly evolving families (foundation models, frameworks with numbered releases), always update the existing entry rather than appending. The list stays lean and relevant.

## What We're Looking For

### ✅ Elite Indicators

- **Sustained adoption** - Growing star count over time, not a spike
- **Production testimonials** - Companies/teams using it in production
- **Ecosystem integration** - Referenced by other major projects
- **Responsive maintenance** - Active issue resolution, regular releases
- **Clear differentiation** - Solves a specific problem better than alternatives
- **Documentation quality** - Proper setup guides, API docs, examples

### 🚩 Disqualifying Red Flags

- Marketing-heavy descriptions without substance
- "Revolutionary" / "next-gen" / "game-changing" hype language
- Single-contributor repos with manufactured star counts
- Forks with minor feature additions claiming to be new projects
- No production users or real-world usage evidence
- Abandoned projects seeking attention
- AI-generated slop (low-effort boilerplate projects)

---

## Submission Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Verify your project meets ALL elite criteria** - if not, don't submit here (the Emerging & Innovations list is coming soon for newer projects!)
2. **Check for duplicates** - search the README first
3. **Ensure correct categorization** - place in the most specific section
4. **Write a factual description** - one sentence, no fluff

### PR Requirements

```markdown
- **[Project Name](https://github.com/owner/repo)** ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/owner/repo?style=social) - Factual one-sentence description.
```

**Good:**
> "High-performance vector search engine built in Rust with hybrid filtering and cloud-native architecture."

**Bad:**
> "The revolutionary next-generation AI-powered vector database disrupting the industry with bleeding-edge performance."

### Required PR Description

Your PR must include:

```markdown
## Project: [Name]

### Elite Criteria Checklist (ALL Required)

- [ ] **Elite Criteria:** ALL criteria met
  - ⭐ Stars: [count] (threshold: 1000+)
  - 🔄 Active: [last commit date] (within 30 days)
  - 🏭 Production: [evidence link] (case study/integration)
  - 📚 Quality: [docs link] (tests/releases)

### Evidence of Production Usage
<!-- Links to case studies, integrations, or production usage -->

### Why This Belongs in Elite Tier
<!-- Explain which criteria you meet and why the project is battle-tested -->

### Category
<!-- Which section this belongs in -->
```

## Maintainer Discretion

The maintainer reserves final judgment on all submissions, including:

- **Rejecting** projects that technically meet criteria but lack production substance
- **Accepting** exceptional projects that may fall short on one criterion but demonstrate unique innovation with strong backing
- **Removing** existing entries if quality degrades or project becomes abandoned
- **Elevating** tools from emerging to elite tier as they mature

**Remember:** Meeting ALL criteria guarantees consideration, not acceptance. This list is about trust and proven value. Maintainer override is reserved for truly exceptional cases only.

---

## Emerging & Experimental Projects

Have a promising project that doesn't meet elite criteria yet?

We maintain a separate **Emerging & Innovations** list for:
- Innovative concepts with <1000 stars
- Early-stage projects with strong potential
- Experimental research implementations
- Niche tools solving specific problems
- **Newer repos that haven't been around long but show promise**

**Coming Soon:** Separate repository and submission process for emerging tools - everyone will get their chance to showcase!

---

## Questions?

Open an issue for discussion before submitting borderline cases. We're happy to help evaluate whether your project fits the elite tier or should wait for the emerging list.
