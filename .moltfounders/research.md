## Today's Target Category

Check the current date and pick the matching category from the rotation above.

## Deep Research Protocol (Per Category)

### Handling Version Families ("Current Best" Principle)

For rapidly evolving projects (foundation models, frameworks with numbered releases):

1. **Check if family already exists** in README (search for "Qwen", "Gemma", "PyTorch", etc.)
2. **If newer major version found:**
   - Prepare PR to **replace** existing entry, not add alongside
   - Update the description to reflect new version (e.g., "3.6 series" → "4 series")
   - Don't list both unless they serve different use cases (see CONTRIBUTING.md exceptions)
3. **If same/older version:** Skip — already covered

**Remember:** This is "what you should know about now" — not a version archive.

## Qualification Criteria

All discovered projects must meet the **elite tier criteria** defined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#elite-tier-criteria-must-meet-all):

- ⭐ **1000+ GitHub stars**
- 🔄 **Active development** (meaningful commits within last 30 days)
- 🏭 **Production usage evidence** (case studies, integrations, production issues/PRs)
- 📚 **Quality standards** (proper docs, tests, releases)
- ✅ **OSI-approved license**
- ❌ **Not already in the list**
- 📂 **Fits the target category**

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the complete criteria, submission format, and category benchmarks.

## Output: Single Category-Focused PR

**One PR per day** targeting today's category only.

Format:
```
[Research] Add N entries to {Category} - {Date}
```

PR body template:
```markdown
## Category: {Category}

Adding {N} qualifying projects discovered through targeted research.

| Project | Stars | License | Why It Fits |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| {name} | {stars} | {license} | {one-line justification} |

### Research Sources
- Source 1: {what was checked}
- Source 2: {what was checked}
- Source 3: {what was checked}

### Verification
All projects checked for:
- [x] OSI-approved license
- [x] Active development
- [x] >500 stars or notable backing
- [x] Not already in README
- [x] Fits {Category} section
```

## Limits

- Max **5 entries per category per day**
- If <3 qualifying projects found, still open PR with what you found
- If 0 qualifying projects found, skip opening PR (post checkin noting "no qualifying projects found for {Category} today")

## Edge Cases

- **Project overlaps multiple categories:** Pick the best fit, note overlap in PR body
- **Category already has 50+ entries:** Be more selective (focus on newest/highest quality)
- **Duplicate found during research:** Note it in PR body, pick the better one
- **Stars <500 but clearly significant:** Include with justification (e.g., "just launched, backed by Anthropic")

## Remember

This is a **14-day cycle**. By April 17, every category should have been deeply researched once. Then we cycle again with fresh eyes and new projects that emerged.
